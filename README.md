# Normal modes of a vibrating circular membrane (drumhead).
---

### Overview
Visualization of the normal modes of vibration of an elastic two-dimensional circular membrane.
Built with Qt framework (C++).
### Applications
* Drumhead
* Eardrum
* Hydrogen atom wave function

### Mathematical analysis and physics
Refer to these links:
* [Vibrations of a circular membrane, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrations_of_a_circular_membrane)
* [Dartmouth college archive](https://math.dartmouth.edu/archive/m23f09/public_html/drum.pdf)

### Build And Run
Just import into Qt Creator, build and run.
Built with Qt Creator 4.3.1, based on Qt 5.9.1 (GCC 5.3.1 20160406 (Red Hat 5.3.1-6), 64 bit).
Only dependency is Boost framework which must be installed in your system.
You must provide the boost include path in Qt's `circular_membrane.pro` file.
